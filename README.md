# 2 Look OLL Trainer
Practice identifying the right algorithms for [2 Look OLL](http://badmephisto.com/2LookOLL.pdf).

## Why Did I Make This?
When I was learning these algorithms, I wish I had a tool like this...
Once I can see the algorithm in action, it is easier for me to memorize it.

## How to use the trainer?
1. Hit Scramble.
2. Do any of the first look algorithms, as needed.
3. Do the second look algorithm to finish the orientation of the last layer.
4. Repeat

You need to line up the cube as you would hold it in your hand to start an algorithm.
Use the y and y' buttons to set it up before you click the algorithm.

The reset button will bring it back to solved in case something goes wrong.

## What is next?
Learning the 2 Look OLL is probably the easiest way to take time off your solve after learning the beginner's method.
Once you can name these quickly, you obviously need to practice with a real cube. Each of the algorithms are related, you will start to see the patterns.
Say the face movements in our head as you do the algorithm. Right, Up, Right Inverse, Up Inverse, etc...
Practice each until you are doing them from muscle memory and you can "look ahead" at what is coming next.
